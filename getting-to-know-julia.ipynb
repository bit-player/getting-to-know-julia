    "When I first started playing with computers, back in the Pleistocene, writing a few lines of code and watching the machine carry out my instructions was enough to give me a little thrill. \"Look! It can count to 10!\" Today, learning a new programming language is my way of reviving that sense of wonder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lately I've been learning [Julia](http://julialang.org/), which describes itself as \"a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for technical computing.\" I've been dabbling with Julia for a couple of years, but this spring I completed my first serious project—my first attempt to do something useful with the language. I wrote a bunch of code to explore correlations between consecutive prime numbers mod _m_, inspired by the [recent paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03720) of Lemke Oliver and Soundararajan. The code from that project, wrapped up in a [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebook, is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/bit-player/primeafterprime). A [bit-player article](http://bit-player.org/2016/prime-after-prime) published last month presented the results of the computation. Here I want to say a few words about my experience with the language.\n",

If you _haven't_ installed Julia, download the notebook anyway. You can upload it to [JuliaBox.org](http://www.juliabox.org) and run it online.

    "\n",
    "A [2014 paper](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.1607v4.pdf) by the founders of the Julia project sets an ambitious goal. To paraphrase: There are languages that make programming quick and easy, and there are languages that make computation fast and efficient. The two sets of languages have long been disjoint. Julia aims to fix that. It offers high-level programming, where algorithms are expressed succinctly and without much fussing over data types and memory allocation. But it also strives to match the performance of lower-level languages such as Fortran and C. Achieving these dual goals requires attention both to the design of the language itself and to the implementation. \n",

    "The Julia project was initiated by a small group at MIT, including Jeff Bezanson, Alan Edelman, Stefan Karpinski, and Viral B. Shah, and has since attracted about 500 contributors. The software is open source, [hosted at GitHub](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia)."

    "In my kind of programming, the end product is not the program itself but the answers it computes. As a result, I favor an incremental and interactive style. I want to write and run small chunks of code—typically individual procedures—without having to build a lot of scaffolding to support them. For a long time I worked mainly in Lisp, although in recent years I've also written a fair amount of Python and JavaScript. I mention all this because my background inevitably colors my judgment of programming languages and environments. If you're a software engineer on a large team building large systems, your needs and priorities are surely different from mine."

As long as `x` is not a prime number, we continue incrementing by 2; when `x` finally lands on a prime value (it must do so eventually, according to Euclid), the `while` loop terminates and the function returns the prime value of `x`.\n",

The syntax owes a lot to MATLAB—most conspicuously the use of the `end` keyword to mark the end of a block, without any corresponding `begin`. The resemblance to MATLAB is more than coincidence; some of the key people in the Julia project have a background in numerical analysis and linear algebra, where MATLAB has long been a standard tool. One of those people is Alan Edelman. I remember asking him, 15 years ago, \"How do you compute the eigenvalues of a matrix?\" He explained: \"You start up MATLAB and type `eig`.\" The same incantation works in Julia.\n",

    "The sparse punctuation and the style of indentation also make Julia code look a little like Python, but in this case the similarity is only superficial.

    "### Multiple Dispatch\n",
    "\n",
    "This sounds like something the 911 operator might do in response to a five-alarm fire, but in fact multiple dispatch is a distinctive core idea in Julia. Understanding what it is and why you might care about it requires a bit of context.\n",
    "\n",
    "In almost all programming languages, an expression along the lines of `x * y` multiplies `x` by `y`, whether `x` and `y` are integers, floating-point numbers, or maybe even complex numbers or matrices. All of these operations qualify as multiplication, but the underlying algorithms—the ways the bits are twiddled to compute the product—are quite different. Thus the `*` operator is _polymorphic_: It's a single symbol that evokes many different actions. One way to handle this situation is to write a single big function—call it `mul(x, y)`—that has a chain of `if... then... else` statements to select the right multiplication algorithm for each `x, y` pair. If you want to multiply all possible combinations of $n$ kinds of numbers, the `if` statement needs $n^2$ branches. Maintaining that monolithic `mul` procedure can become a headache. Suppose you want to add a new type of number, such as quaternions. You would have to patch in new routines throughout the existing `mul` code.\n",
    "\n",
    "When object-oriented programming (OOP) swept through the world of computing in the 1980s, it offered an alternative. In an object-oriented setting, each class of numbers has its own set of multiplication procedures, or _methods_. Instead of one universal `mul` function, there's a `mul` method for integers, another `mul` for floats, and so on. To multiply `x` by `y`, you don't write `mul(x, y)` but rather something like `x.mul(y)`. The object-oriented programmer thinks of this protocol as sending a message to the `x` object, asking it to apply its `mul` method to the `y` argument. You can also describe the scheme as a _single-dispatch_ mechanism. The dispatcher is a behind-the-scenes component that keeps track of all methods with the same name, such as `mul`, and chooses which of those methods to invoke based on the data type of the single argument `x`. (The `x` object still needs some internal mechanism to examine the type of `y` to know which of its own methods to apply.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple dispatch is a generalization of single dispatch. The dispatcher looks at _all_ the arguments and their types, and chooses the method accordingly. Once that decision is made, no further choices are needed. There might be separate `mul` methods for combining two integers, for an integer and a float, for a float and a complex, etc. Julia has 138 methods linked to the multiplication operator `*`, including a few mildly surprising combinations. (Quick, what's the value of `false * 42`?)"

    "Before Julia came along, the best-known example of multiple dispatch was the Common Lisp Object System, or CLOS. As a Lisp guy, I'm familiar with CLOS, but I've seldom found it useful; it's too heavy a hammer for most of my little nails. But whereas CLOS is an optional add-on to Lisp, multiple dispatch is deeply embedded in the infrastructure of Julia. You can't really ignore it.\n",

So I tried writing separate methods `next_prime(x::Int)` and `next_prime(x::BigInt)`. The result, however, was annoying code duplication: The bodies of those two methods were identical.

    "### Multiple dispatch vs. OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "In CLOS, multiple dispatch is an adjunct to an object-oriented programming system; in Julia, multiple dispatch is an _alternative_ to OOP, and perhaps a repudiation of it. OOP is a noun-centered protocol: Objects are things that own both data and procedures that act on the data. Julia is verb-centered: Procedures (or functions) are the active elements of a program, and they can be applied to any data, not just their own private variables. The Julia documentation [notes](http://docs.julialang.org/en/release-0.4/manual/methods/):\n",
    "\n",
    "> Multiple dispatch is particularly useful for mathematical code, where it makes little sense to artificially deem the operations to “belong” to one argument more than any of the others: does the addition operation in `x + y` belong to `x` any more than it does to `y`? The implementation of a mathematical operator generally depends on the types of all of its arguments. Even beyond mathematical operations, however, multiple dispatch ends up being a powerful and convenient paradigm for structuring and organizing programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "I agree about the peculiar asymmetry of asking `x` to add `y` to itself. And yet that's only one small aspect of what object-oriented programming is all about. There are many occasions when it's really handy to bundle up related code and data in an object, if only for the sake of tidyness. If I had been writing my primes program in an object-oriented language, I would have created a class of objects to hold various properties of a sequence of consecutive primes, and then instantiated that class for each sequence I generated. Some of the object fields would have been simple data, such as the length of the sequence. Others would have been procedures for calculating more elaborate statistics. Some of the data and procedures would have been private—accessible only from within the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "No such facility exists in Julia, but there are other ways of addressing some of the same needs. Julia's user-defined composite types look very much like objects in some respects; they even use the same dot notation for field access that you see in Java, JavaScript and Python. A type definition looks like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "    type Location\n",
    "        latitude::Float64\n",
    "        longitude::Float64\n",
    "    end\n",
    "        \n",
    "Given a variable of this type, such as `Paris = Location(48.8566, 2.3522)`, you can access the two fields as `Paris.latitude` and `Paris.longitude`. You can even have a field of type `Function` inside a composite type, as in this declaration:\n",
    "\n",
    "    type Location\n",
    "        latitude::Float64\n",
    "        longitude::Float64\n",
    "        distance_to_pole::Function\n",
    "    end\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, if you store an appropriate function in that field, you can invoke it as `Paris.distance_to_pole()`. However, the function has no special access to the other fields of the type; in particular, it doesn't know which `Location` it's being called from, so it doesn't work like an OOP method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Julia also has _modules_, which are essentially private namespaces. Only variables that are explicitly marked as `exported` can be seen from outside a module. A module can encapsulate both code and data, and so it is probably the closest approach to objects as a mechanism of program organization. But there's still nothing like the _this_ or _self_ keyword of true object-oriented languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is it brave or foolish, at this point in the history of computer science, to turn your back on the object-oriented paradigm and try something else? It's surely bold. Two or three generations of programmers have grown up on a steady diet OOP. On the other hand, we have not yet found the One True Path to software wisdom, so there's surely room for exploring other corners of the ecosystem."

    "### Exactness\n",
    "\n",
    "A language for \"technical computing\" had better have strong numerical abilities. Julia has the full gamut of numeric types, with integers of various fixed sizes (from 8 bits to 128 bits), both signed and unsigned, and a comparable spectrum of floating-point precisions. There are also `BigInts` and `BigFloats` that expand to accommodate numbers of any size (up to the bounds of available memory). And you can do arithmetic with complex numbers and exact rationals.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a well-stocked toolkit, suitable for many kinds of computations. However, the emphasis is on fast floating-point arithmetic with real or complex values, approximated at machine precision. If you want to work in number theory, combinatorics, or cryptography—fields that require exact integers and rational numbers of unbounded size—the tools are provided, but using them requires some extra contortions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To my taste, the most elegant implementation of numeric types is found in the Scheme programming language, a dialect of Lisp. The Scheme numeric \"tower\" begins with integers at its base. The integers are a subset of the rational numbers, which in turn are a subset of the reals, which are a subset of the complex numbers. Alongside this hierarchy, and orthogonal to it, Scheme also distinguishes between exact and inexact numbers. Integers and rationals can be represented exactly in a computer system, but many real and complex values can only be approximated, usually by floating-point numbers. In doing basic arithmetic, the Scheme interpreter or compiler preserves exactness. This is easy when you're adding, subtracting, or multiplying integers, since the result is also invariably an integer. With division of integers, Scheme returns an integer when possible (e.g., $15 \\div 3 = 5$) and otherwise an exact rational ($4 \\div 6 = 2/3$). Some Schemes go a step further and return exact results for operations such as square root, when it's possible to do so ($\\sqrt{4/9} = 2/3$; but $\\sqrt{5} = 2.236068$; the latter is inexact). These are numbers you can count on; they mostly obey well-known principles of mathematics, such as $\\frac{m}{n} \\times \\frac{n}{m} = 1$.\n",

    "### Incremental Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Julia works splendidly as a platform for incremental, interactive, exploratory programming. There's no need to write and compile a program as a monolithic structure, with a `main` function as entry point. You can write a single procedure, immediately compile it and run it, test it, modify it, and examine the assembly code generated by the compiler. It's _ad hack_ programming at its best.\n",
    "\n",
    "To support this style of work and play, Julia comes with a built-in REPL, or read-eval-print loop, that operates from a command-line interface. Type an expression at the prompt, press enter, and the system executes the code (compiling if necessary); the value is printed, followed by a new prompt for the next command:\n",
    "\n",
    "![The Julia REPL](Julia-REPL.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The REPL is pretty good, but I prefer working in a Jupyter notebook (like this one), which runs in a web browser. There's also a development environment called [Juno](http://junolab.org/), but I haven't yet done much with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "An incremental and iterative style of development can be a challenge for the compiler. When you process an entire program in one piece, the compiler starts from a blank slate. When you compile individual functions, which need to interact with functions compiled earlier, it's all too easy for the various parts of the system to get out of sync. Gears may fail to mesh.\n",
    "\n",
    "Problems of this kind can come up with any language, but multiple dispatch introduces some unique quirks. Suppose you're writing Julia code in a Jupyter notebook. You write and compile a function `f(x)`, which the system accepts as a \"generic function with one method.\" Later you realize that `f` should have been a function of two arguments, and so you go back to edit the definition. The modified source code now reads `f(x, y)`. In most languages, this new definition of `f` would replace the old one, which would thereafter cease to exist. But in Julia you have haven't replaced anything; instead you now have a \"generic function with 2 methods.\" The first definition is still present and active in the internal workspace, and so you can call both `f(x)` and `f(x, y)`. However, the source code for `f(x)` is nowhere to be found in the notebook. Thus if you end the Jupyter session and later reload the file, any calls to `f(x)` will produce an error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "A [similar but subtler problem](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/265) with redefinitions has been a subject of active discussion among the Julia developers for almost five years. There's hope for a fix in the next major release.\n",
    "\n",
    "If redefining a function during an interactive session can lead to confusion, trying to redefine a custom type runs into an impassable barrier. Types are immutable. Once defined, they can't be modified in any way. If you create a type `T` with two fields `a` and `b`, then later decide you also need a field `c`, you're stuck. The only way to redefine the type is to shut down the session and restart, losing all computations completed so far. How annoying. There's a workaround: If you put the type definition inside a module, you can simply reload the module."

    "### Idiosyncrasies\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes it's the little things that arouse the most heated controversy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In counting things, Julia generally starts with 1. A vector with `n` elements is indexed from `1` through `n`. This is also the default convention in Fortran, MATLAB, Mathematica, and a few other languages; the C family, Python, and JavaScript count from `0` through `n-1`. The wisdom of 1-based indexing has been a subject of long and spirited debate on the [Julia issues forum](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/558), on the [developer mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!topic/julia-dev/tNN72FnYbYQ), and on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23228342/numbering-of-array-indices-in-julia).\n",
    "\n",
    "Programs where the choice of indexing origin makes any difference are probably rare, but as it happens my primes study was one of them. I was looking at primes reduced modulo $m$, and counting the number of primes in each of the $m$ possible residue classes. Since the residues range from $0$ to $m - 1$, it would have been convenient to store the counts in an array with those indices. However, I did not find it terribly onerous to add $1$ to each index.\n",
    "\n",
    "Blessedly, the indexing war may soon be over. Tim Holy, a biologist and intrepid Julia contributor, discovered a way to give users free choice of indexing with only a few lines of code and little cost in efficiency. An [experimental version](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/c2e34945b02824a254168646eca7a33b3125519d/doc/devdocs/offset-arrays.rst) of this new mechanism is in the 0.5 developer release.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the indexing truce, we can still fight over the storage order for arrays and matrices. Julia again follows the precedent of Fortran and MATLAB, reading arrays in column-major order. Given the matrix \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{matrix}\n",
    "    x_{11} & x_{12} & x_{13} \\\\\n",
    "    x_{21} & x_{22} & x_{23} \\\\\n",
    "\\end{matrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Julia will serialize the elements as $x_{11}, x_{21}, x_{12}, x_{22}, x_{13}, x_{23}$. C and many other recent languages read across the rows rather than down the columns. This is another largely arbitrary convention, although it may be of some practical importance that most graphic formats are row-major.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally there's the pressing question of what symbol to choose for the string-concatenation operator. Where Python has `\"abc\" + \"def\" ⇒ \"abcdef\"`, Julia does `\"abc\" * \"def\" ⇒ \"abcdef\"`. The reason cited is pretty doctrinaire: In abstract algebras, '+' generally denotes a commutative operation, and string concatenation is not commutative. If you'd like to know more, see the [extensive, long-running discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/julia-users/nQg_d_n0t1Q/9PSt5aya5TsJ)."

    "The [official online documentation](http://docs.julialang.org/en/release-0.4/) is reasonably complete, consistent, and clearly written, but it gives too few examples.

    "As far as I know, Julia has no standard or specification document, which is an interesting absence. For a long time, programming languages had rather careful, formal descriptions of syntax and semantics, laying out exactly which expressions were legal and meaningful in a program. Sometimes the standard came first, before anyone tried to write a compiler or interpreter; Algol 60 was the premier example of this discipline. Sometimes the standard came after, as a device to reconcile diverging implementations; this was the situation with Lisp and C. For now, at least, Julia is apparently defined only by its evolving implementation.

    "### The Future\n",
    "\n",
    "The rise and fall of programming languages seems to be governed by a highly nonlinear dynamic. Why is Python so popular? Because it's so popular! With millions of users, there are more add-on packages, more books and articles, more conferences, more showcase applications, more jobs for Python programmers, more classes where Python is the language of instruction. Success breeds success. It's a bandwagon effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this rich-get-richer economy were the whole story, the world would have only one viable programming language. But there's a price to be paid for popularity: The overcrowded bandwagon gets trapped in its own wheel ruts and becomes impossible to steer. Think of those 85,000 Python packages. If an improvement in the core language is incompatible with too much of that existing code, the change can be made only with great effort. For example, persuading Python users to migrate from version 2 to version 3 has taken eight years, and the transition is not complete yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Julia is approaching the moment when these contrary imperatives—to gain momentum but to stay maneuverable—both become powerful. At the recent JuliaCon, Stefan Karpinsky gave a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gXMpbY1kJY&list=PLP8iPy9hna6SQPwZUDtAM59-wPzCPyD_S&index=4) on the path to version 1.0 and beyond. The audience listened with the kind of studious attention that Janet Yellin gets when she announces Fed policy on inflation and interest rates. Toward the end, Karpinsky unveiled the plan: to release version 1.0 within a year, by the time of the 2017 JuliaCon. Cheers and applause.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 1.0 label connotes maturity—or at least adulthood. It's a signal that the language is out of school and ready for work in the real-world. And thus begins the struggle to gain momentum while continuing to innovate. For members of Julia's developer group, there might be a parallel conflict between making a living and continuing to have fun. I'm fervently hoping all these tensions can be resolved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Will Julia attract enough interest to grow and thrive? I feel I can best address that question by turning it back on myself. Will _I_ continue to write code in Julia? \n",
    "\n",
    "I've said that I do exploratory programming, but I also do _expository_ programming. Computational experiments are an essential part of my work as a science writer. They help me understand what I'm writing about, and they also aid in the storytelling process, through simulations, computer-generated illustrations, and interactive gadgets. Although only a small subset of my readers ever glance at the code I publish, I want to maximize their number and do all I can to deepen their engagement—enticing them to read the code, run it, modify it, and ideally build on it. At this moment, Julia is not the most obvious choice for reaching a broad audience of computational dabblers, but I think it has considerable promise. In some respects, getting started with Julia is easier than it is with Python, if only because there's less prior art—less to install and configure. I expect to continue working in other languages as well, but I do want to try some more Julia experiments."
