# Getting to Know Julia

This is the Jupyter notebook version of the bit-player blog post of the same title: [http://bit-player.org/2016/getting-to-know-julia](http://bit-player.org/2016/getting-to-know-julia).

If you just want to read the document, I suggest the bit-player.org version; the formatting is pleasanter. If you want to run the code, but you don't have a working installation of Julia and Jupyter, try it on [JuliaBox.org](http://www.juliabox.org).
